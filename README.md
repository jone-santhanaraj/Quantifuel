## Introduction

Quantifuel is designed to address the challenges faced in fuel stations, focusing on:

- Ensuring accurate fuel dispensing through serialized pumps.
- Enhancing transaction transparency for customers.
- Streamlining fuel station management operations.

## Features

- **Fuel Station Management**

  - Create, update, and manage fuel stations.
  - Assign serialized pumps to each station.

- **Pump Serialization**

  - Generate unique identification numbers (UPINs) for each pump.
  - QR code generation for easy identification and tracking.

- **Transaction Transparency**
  - Record and monitor fuel transactions.
  - Provide customers with transaction details for transparency.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Database**: MongoDB (using Mongoose ODM)
- **QR Code Generation**: qrcode npm module
- **Image Processing**: sharp npm module
- **Other Tools**: crypto, fs (File System), path

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

- git clone https://github.com/jone-santhanaraj/Quantifuel.git
- cd Quantifuel

2. Install dependencies:
