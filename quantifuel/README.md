## Introduction

Quantifuel is designed to address the challenges faced in fuel stations, focusing on:

- Ensuring accurate fuel dispensing through serialized pumps.
- Enhancing transaction transparency for customers.
- Streamlining fuel station management operations.

## Features

- **Fuel Station Management**

  - Create, update, and manage fuel stations.
  - Assign serialized pumps to each station.

- **Pump Serialization**

  - Generate unique identification numbers (UPINs) for each pump.
  - QR code generation for easy identification and tracking.

- **User and Transaction Serialization**

  - Assign unique identification numbers to every individual pump, fuel station, and user, including fuel station admins and pump operators.
  - Fuel stations are assigned a unique 6-digit hexadecimal code called UFSIN (Unique Fuel Station Identification Number).
  - Pumps are assigned a unique 4-digit hexadecimal code called UPIN (Unique Pump Identification Number).
  - Every user is assigned a unique 8-digit hexadecimal code called UUIN (Unique User Identification Number).
  - Every transaction is assigned a unique 8-digit hexadecimal code called UTIN (Unique Transaction Identification Number).
  - The use of hexadecimal codes provides the highest possible number of pumps, fuel stations, and user base in our system, with numbers reaching up to:

- **Transaction Transparency**
  - Record and monitor fuel transactions.
  - Provide customers with transaction details for transparency.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Database**: MongoDB (using Mongoose ODM)
- **QR Code Generation**: qrcode npm module
- **Image Processing**: sharp npm module
- **Other Tools**: crypto, fs (File System), path

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

- `git clone https://github.com/jone-santhanaraj/Quantifuel.git`
- `cd Quantifuel`

2. Install dependencies:

- `npm install`

3. Set up environment variables:

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
- Define environment variables like `PORT`, `MONGODB_URI`, etc.

4. Start the server:

- `npm start`

## Usage

- **Creating a Fuel Station**:

  - Use the API endpoint to create a new fuel station.
  - Provide required details such as name and address.

- **Managing Pumps**:
  - Generate UPINs for pumps associated with each fuel station.
  - Monitor pump status and transaction history.
